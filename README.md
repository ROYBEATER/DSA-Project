# DSA-Project

This C++ project demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in an undirected, weighted graph. The graph structure is created using linked lists, with nodes and edges representing intersections and distances, making it a simplified clone of a navigation system like Google Maps.

Features Graph Representation: Uses linked lists to store and manage nodes and edges for a memory-efficient, dynamic graph structure. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Implements a priority queue (min-heap) to optimize the shortest path search. Edge Addition: Allows for undirected edges with weights, representing distances between nodes. Debugging Support: Prints graph data to verify connections and distances. User Interaction: Prompts for source and destination nodes, then calculates and displays the shortest path and its distance.

Code Overview Graph Class: Manages nodes and edges using linked lists, with methods for edge addition and graph display. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Computes shortest paths, optimizing distances with priority queues and managing updates dynamically. Main Function: Initializes the graph, adds nodes and edges, and prompts user input for start and end points. This project serves as a practical example of Dijkstra's algorithm, especially useful for beginners in C++ and graph theory, and demonstrates linked list data structures in real-world applications.
